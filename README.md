# 📈 Woodstock: Stock Price Prediction Dashboard

Woodstock is a machine learning-powered application that predicts stock prices using historical data and sentiment analysis. It leverages multiple models including XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, and Linear Regression — allowing users to analyze, compare, and visualize model performance and stock behavior.

# 📈 Woodstock: Stock Price Prediction Dashboard

**Woodstock** is a machine learning-based project designed to predict stock prices using historical data and sentiment analysis. The project features multiple models (XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, Linear Regression), interactive visualizations, and a modular pipeline that supports experimentation and explainability.
